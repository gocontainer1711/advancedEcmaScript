# Composition vs Inheritance

### Inheritance

* components divided on basis of heirarchy of real life objects (what it is ?)
* Tight Coupling between Super and sub class. change something on class, sub class may break
* Multiple Heirarchy plus a lot of ancestoral code is received by the child class. Heavy child class.


### Composition

* components divided on solving a single purpose (What it does ? )
* You can create all of the different elements needed (objects, functions, etc.) and piece them together as needed
* It can be more difficult to follow and read
* Composition can be easier to refactor and avoid side-effects
* It requires less planning



Composition is better than Inheritance ?
